Old enough to know you're trouble!
I'm 9183 days, 3 hours and 22 minutes.
Age is just a number and mine is unlisted.
Age doesn't matter unless you are cheese or wine.
Don't you mean how YOUNG am I?
Old enough to take keen interest in world affairs, young enough to never be taken seriously.
I've cleverly disguised myself as a responsible adult.
