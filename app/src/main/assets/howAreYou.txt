I'M BETTER ON THE INSIDE THAN I LOOK ON THE OUTSIDE.
WELL CAN'T COMPLAINâ€¦.  I'VE TRIED, BUT NO ONE LISTENS.
HOPEFULLY NOT AS GOOD AS I'LL EVER BE.
IF I WAS ANY BETTER, VITAMINS WOULD BE TAKING ME.
OKAY. I'D BE BETTER IF YOU ASKED ME OUT.
I'm alright, slight bruises here and there, nothing i can't handle.
Today I am an orange, tomorrow I'll be a coconut.
Spiritually? Physically? Socioeconomically? Well?
My lawyer says I don't have to answer that question. 
Well, I haven't had my morning coffee yet and no one has gotten hurt, so I'd say "pretty good" at this point.
Better than I deserve.
Walking and talking.
I'm busier than a puppy in a room full of rubber balls.
I'm more nervous than a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.
Living the dream!
Another day, another dollar or Another day, another fifty cents.
Could be better.
Could be worse.
Better than a minute ago.
Better than most, worse than some!.
Can't complain, and nobody listens anyway!.
Stumblin' along!.
One foot in the grave, the other slipping of the brake pedal.
First things first. 'How are YOU doing?
Much better, thanks!
Reasonable!
vertical, functioning but not yet caffeinated.
I'm super, thanks for asking!
Definitely not dead yet!
i'm living the dream
Can't complain, boss won't let me.
